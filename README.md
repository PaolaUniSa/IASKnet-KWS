IASKnet-KWS: Integrated circuit design generated by Ai of a Spiking neural NETwork for KeyWord Spotting 


Keyword spotting (KWS) systems play a vital role in various applications, ranging from voice-controlled assistants to security surveillance. However, the demand for energy-efficient KWS solutions persists as traditional methods often face limitations in terms of power consumption and real-time processing.

This project presents an approach to address these challenges by harnessing the power of generative AI and open-source hardware design tools to develop an energy-efficient KWS hardware accelerator based on a Spiking Neural Network (SNN).

The proposed project aims to showcase how generative AI, particularly ChatGPT, can significantly aid Integrated Circuit (IC) designers in developing and testing IC designs for KWS.
By leveraging ChatGPT's natural language processing capabilities, designers can efficiently generate and refine specifications, architecture designs, and testing protocols for the KWS hardware accelerator. This integration of generative AI streamlines the design process, reducing time-to-market and enhancing overall design quality.

Furthermore, the project seeks to demonstrate the efficacy of open-source hardware design tools in fostering innovation and lower the barrier to entry for IC designers, promoting transparency and accessibility in IC designs. Through the dissemination of design files, methodologies, and documentation, the project aims to raise awareness of open-source silicon and inspire a community-driven approach to hardware innovation.

Central to the proposed solution is the utilization of a SNN for keyword spotting. SNNs offer several advantages over traditional neural networks, including improved energy efficiency, sparse activation patterns, and inherent temporal processing capabilities. 

By demonstrating the feasibility and efficacy of developing an energy-efficient KWS hardware accelerator by combining the power of generative AI and open-source hardware design tools, the project aims to promote the adoption of these open-source tools and the potential of generative AI.
